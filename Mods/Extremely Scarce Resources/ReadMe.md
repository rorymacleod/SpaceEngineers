Extremely Scarce Resources
==========================
Removes deposits for basic metals, meaning that you will mostly have to 
scavenge or trade for iron, nickel, and silicon. Stone can still be processed, 
but at greatly reduced yields, so you would need to mine huge amounts of it to
be worthwhile. Oxygen generation is reduced, but oxygen farm yield is
increased to make them more viable.

(Note: This mod replaces the production-related changes in Splitsie's 
Survival Less Likely)

Yields:
- Stone produces 1% of vanilla outputs, or 0.5% in the survival kit
- Ingot yields from their ores are reduced to ~60%, or half that in the survival kit

Production:
- Large refinery does not process stone
- Oxygen farm output increased 5x
- Oxygen generator O2 output reduced to 1%, H2 output reduced by 50%

Rocks:
- Earth rocks, snow biome: 25% chance of iron, nickel, silicon, or cobalt
- Earth rocks, forest biome: 12% chance of magnesium, then as above
- Earth rocks, desert biome: 32% chance of magnesium, then as above
- Earth rocks, high grass biome: 20% ice, 80% iron
- Mars rocks: 10% chance of platinum, 30% of iron, nickel, or silicon
- Moon rocks: 25% gold, 25% silver, 50% iron. Density increased 10x
- Europa rocks: 20% iron, 80% ice
- Titan rocks: 10% iron, 10% cobalt, 40% nickel, 40% silicon
- Alien rocks: 30% iron, 30% nickel, 30% silicon, 10% uraninite

Ores
- Earth ores: None
- Alien ores: All ores are present in small amounts
- Mars ores: Ice and platinum
- Moon ores: None
- Europa ores: None
- Titan ores: None
- Pertram ores: Magnesium and cobalt
- Triton ores: Silver, magnesium, and gold

Asteroids
- Only iron, nickel, silicon, and ice spawn in asteroids and meteorites

Atmosphere
- Mars: Density and wind speed reduced to 10%
- Europa: No atmosphere
