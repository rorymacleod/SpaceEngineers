Survival A Bit More Likely
==========================
This is a replacement or adjustment for Splitsie's Survival Less Likely
that makes the jetpack function in atmosphere, but with much less thrust
compared to vanilla.

It does not include any of the block-related changes, so it is intended 
to be used with either Survival Less Likely, or Extremely Scarce Resources.

Changes:
- Oxygen bottle capacity reduced to 60 from 100
- Hydrogen bottle capacity reduced to 120 from 1000
- Ice volume increased to 0.6 from 0.37
- Oxygen consumption increased 10x
- Hydrogen capacity reduced to 80 from 125
- Oxygen capacity reduced to 40 from 60
- Suit consumption in temperature extremes increased to 4 from 2.5
- Jetpack thrust reduced from 3200 to 2000
- Jetpack consumption per G increased to 800 from 250
